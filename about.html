<h3>Panties With A Purpose!</h3>

<p>We all want to do our part to help improve the environment. Sure, we recycle, we buy organic produce, and we occasionally carpool, but beyond that it's tough to sacrifice convenience for the bigger picture. EcoFashion offers another alternative to do what we are already doing in a more eco-friendly way. Previously, EcoFashion alternatives have been associated with drab colors, rough fabrics, and not very fashion forward or flattering fits. Lazy Glamour hopes to help change that by offering clothing that is chic, fits well, and is made from sustainable fabrics in an environmentally-aware way. </p>

<p>All of our products are designed with sustainability in mind.  Lazy Glamour apparel utilizes sustainable fabrics that are grown, produced, and processed using environmentally friendly methods. They're soft and silky, yet durable. So you can look sexy while doing your part to save the planet &#45; environmentalism that fits right into a "lazy" lifestyle! </p>

<p>To find out more about our fabrics, check out our <a href="ecofashion3.html" >EcoFashion</a> page.</p>
