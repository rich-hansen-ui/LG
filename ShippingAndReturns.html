<h3>Lazy Glamour Shipping Policy</h3>

<p>We want you to feel comfortable buying from us, and we don't want shipping costs to get in the way of trying Lazy Glamour, because we know you are going to love our undies.</p>

<p>Our shipping policy is simple, free standard shipping on all domestic orders. We ship via USPS and UPS. We are happy to offer shipping upgrades as well, and we will charge only what the carrier charges us.</p>

<h3>LG Returns & Exchanges</h3>
<p>We want you to be completely satisfied with your Lazy Glamour purchase, and if you aren't (due to fit, style, or any other reason) we want to make it right.</p>

<p>Our return policy is 30 days to return or exchange an item. We will happily issue you a full refund or exchange it for another item or size. We cannot guarantee that we will have the same item you originally purchased in stock, but we can work with you to find you another item that will make you just as happy.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, due to health regulations, and general hygiene, we cannot accept returns or exchanges on any undergarments that show any signs of having been washed or worn. When trying on undergarments, please wear a pair of your own underneath.</p>
