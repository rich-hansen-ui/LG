<h3>Sizing & Ordering</h3>
<p><b>How do I know what size to order?</b>
The right fit is key. Your panties should fit snug (so they stay in place, but not tight. We believe nothing is more unflattering than tight underwear on a woman! We've put hours of research into finding just the right elastic to give you a comfortable, flattering fit. That being said, you can find your perfect fit by following the guide below:
<table>
	  <tr>
	    <td></td>
        <td>X-Small</td>
	    <td>Small</td>
		<td>Medium</td>
		<td>Large</td>
        <td>X-Large</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>Size</td>
        <td>0-2</td>
	    <td>4-6</td>
	    <td>8-10</td>
	    <td>10-12</td>
	    <td>14-16</td>
		</tr>
	</table> 

<p><b>How do I place an order? Can I place an order by phone or mail?</b>
Lazy Glamour is exclusively available at www.lazyglamour.com. The best way to order is to shop online at www.lazyglamour.com. </p>

<p>If you would like to make a particularly large or complicated order, you can contact us at <a href="mailto://concierge@lazyglamour.com" >concierge@lazyglamour.com</a> to place this order. We cannot accept orders by mail at this time.</p>

<h3>Shipping</h3>
<p><b>I just placed an order online. When can I expect to receive my order in the mail?</b>
Most orders are shipped by either USPS or UPS, and should arrive in 5-7 days from the time your order was placed. Lazy Glamour also offers a variety of express shipping options, but these methods do incur additional charges and are less environmentally sustainable options (UPS and Fedex have a much larger carbon footprint than the United States Postal Service) so we encourage you to take advantage of our free shipping via USPS. See our <a href="Shipping & Returns.html" >Shipping Policy</a> for more information.</p>
 
<h3>Returns & Exchanges</h3>
<p><b>I ordered the wrong size. How do I get the right size?</b>
We want you to LOVE your Lazy Glamour clothing, so if you ordered a size that doesn't fit just right, let us know and we'll make it right. We offer a 30 day return and exchange policy. See our <a href="ShippingAndReturns.html" >Return & Exchange</a> Policy for more information. </p>

<p><b>I received the wrong items, how do I exchange them?</b>
If there is a mistake with your order, please email us at <a href="mailto://concierge@lazyglamour.com" >concierge@lazyglamour.com</a> and include your order number and a full description of the mistake. We'll send you the correct items right away.</p>

<h3>Privacy & Security</h3>
<p><b>Is my credit card information stored safely?</b>
Lazy Glamour does not store your credit card information on its servers. Your information is securely handled by Paypal for processing.</p> 

<p><b>How is the information I give in the order process used?</b>
The information you provide during the checkout process is only used to complete the order transaction.  Your email address may be used for future marketing (we want to make sure you know about new products and deals we offer). Lazy Glamour will never sell or distribute your email or other contact information to a third party.</p>
