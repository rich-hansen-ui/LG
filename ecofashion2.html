<h3>What makes a garment EcoFashion? </h3>
<p>The following is a set of criteria, used to evaluate eco initiatives, established by Eco Fashion Week and the Green Advisory Board.</p>

<p> Lazy Glamour meets many of these criteria (as indicated by a *).</p>

<p><b>*FAIR/ETHICAL TRADE:</b> responsibility towards human rights, reasonable work hours, 
no child labour, the right to unionize, a fair living wage, higher environmental and 
social standards. No direct environmental influences that impact on people in the 
workplace in the form of vapours, gases, dust particles, noise, temperature, etc.</p>        

<p><b>*LOCAL:</b> Designed and constructed in your local community.</p>

<p><b>CUSTOM/TAILOR MADE:</b> Also called demi-couture or made-to-order. This is a way 
of encouraging quality and "slow fashion" over mass-produced disposable fashion. </p>

<p><b>*ORGANIC/NATURAL TEXTILES AND MATERIALS:</b> Woven/fabric from natural sources like bamboo, SeaCellï (seaweed) Ingeoï (corn), milk fiber , hemp, nettle, wool, peace silk, soy silk, wood, rubber, cork ,cupro and other exotic sustaining plants. Natural fibers that have been grown without any pesticides or other toxic materials, preserving the health of humans and the 
environment. The process of organic growth can be certified by various organizations. </p>

<p><b>RECYCLED/REBORN:</b> Created with reclaimed, recycled or repurposed materials. Anything that has been made from already existing materials, fabrics, metals or fibers. These are often reclaimed from previously made clothing and accessories and reworked into new ones. Fibers can also be re-purposed from pre-existing fabric, re-spun and reused for new garments. </p>   

<p><b>*ECO PRINTING:</b> Use of environmentally responsible printing processes.</p>

<p><b>*FABRIC WASTE REDUCTION:</b> In the production cycle, as little fabric wastage as possible in cutting and sewing process. </p>               

<p><b>*GREEN MARKETING:</b> Offsets, Packaging, labeling, promotion, business cards, etc. </p>

<p><b>*SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE:</b> Promoting an awareness of environmental and/or social issues.  Participating in eco program like 1% for the planet. </p>                

<p><b>*RESOURCE EFFICIENCY:</b> Generate the greatest possible benefit using the smallest possible quantity of natural resources. Water-efficient closed loop, no substances that enter the waste water path via a wet process. </p>

<p><b>VINTAGE/SECOND HAND:</b> Vintage is a generic term for new or second hand garments created in the period from the 1920's to 1980's. However, the term is often used more generally for second-hand clothes or up-cycled clothes (articles of clothing that has been given a new life through some sort of customization). </p>

<p><b>VEGAN/ ANIMAL FREE/ CRUELTY FREE:</b> Involving no animal testing or unjust labor practices. Products that have been made without the use of leather or animal tissue products e.g. fur, milk fibers, silk...  Low impact/Natural/Vegetable dying:  Dyes made from a class of colorants extracted from vegetative matter and animal residues: berries, seeds, vegetables,  leaves, plants, etc. </p>

<p><b>ECO - CERTIFICATION:</b> Is your brand granted with an Eco Certification? (Not yet, but we are working hard to get there!)</p>
