<h3>Lazy Glamour Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>This policy covers how Lazy Glamour treats personal information that Lazy Glamour collects and receives, including information related to your past use of Lazy Glamour products. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Lazy Glamour does not own or control, or to people that Lazy Glamour does not employ or manage.
Collecting Information</p>

<p>Lazy Glamour collects personal information when you register with Lazy Glamour, when you use Lazy Glamour products, when you visit Lazy Glamour pages or the pages of certain Lazy Glamour partners, and when you enter promotions or sweepstakes. Lazy Glamour may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies. When you register we ask for information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, zip code, occupation, industry, and personal interests. Once you register with Lazy Glamour and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. Lazy Glamour automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, Lazy Glamour cookie information, and the page you request. Lazy Glamour uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the Lazy Glamour service, such as service announcements, administrative messages and the Lazy Glamour Newsletter, that are considered part of your Lazy Glamour account, without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them. You can delete your account by contacting Lazy Glamour.</p>

<h5>Confidentiality and Security</h5>

<p>We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect personal information about you.</p>

<h5>Protecting Your Information</h5>

<p>Lazy Glamour does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:</p>

    <p>We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Lazy Glamour under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help Lazy Glamour communicate with you about offers from Lazy Glamour and our marketing partners.</p>
    
    <p>We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;
    <p>We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Lazy Glamour' terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.</p>
    <p>We transfer information about you if Lazy Glamour is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Lazy Glamour will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>

<h5>Policy Updates</h5>

<p>Lazy Glamour may update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your Lazy Glamour account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.</p>
