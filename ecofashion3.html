<h3>How is Lazy Glamour considered EcoFashion?</h3>

<h4>Our Fabrics:</h4><p>Lazy Glamour apparel features sustainable fabrics that are grown, produced, and processed using environmentally friendly methods.</p>

<h5>Modal</h5>
<p>Modal is a manufactured fiber of made from beech trees. Modal has the most desirable properties of any cellulose fiber-- it's soft and has a silky appearance. It's 50% more water absorbent than cotton, and is chemical, moth, and mildew resistant. The solvent used during the production process is easily recycled without any contamination. Also, Modal is biodegradable, since the fiber is extracted from pure wood.</p>

<p>The beech tree puts down very deep roots and is thought to be unbeatable when it comes to improving the soil. It is extremely resistant to pests and environmental damages. The special characteristic about the growth of the beech tree is that they multiply via what is known as "rejuvenation" which means that the tree population practically grows itself. No planting or artificial irrigation are required. Beech groves are a completely sustainable resource.</p>

<h5>Bamboo</h5>
<p>Bamboo fabrics look and feel like silk, but are more practical because they can be machine washed and dried. Bamboo fibers are naturally anti-bacterial and absorbent, drawing moisture away from the skin, keeping you cool and dry.</p>

<p>A regenerated natural cellulose fiber, bamboo is also 100% biodegradable. As a crop, bamboo is very sustainable to grow as it does not require the use of any pesticides. It can restore degraded lands. It is a pioneering plant and can be grown in soil damaged by overgrazing and poor agriculture.</p>

<h5>Organic Cotton</h5>
<p>Conventional cotton is produced using heavy pesticides that contain chloride compounds, which, when airborne, become dioxin, a carcinogen linked to breast cancer and prostate cancer. Organic cotton is grown in an environment where no pesticides, herbicides, or chemical fertilizers have been used for a minimum period of three years. Organic cotton is produced according to strict regulations, with dyeing and finishing processes that are harmless to both humans and the environment.</p>

<h4>Our Business Practices:</h4>
<p>Lazy Glamour strives to be as "green" as possible in all aspects of our business.</p>

<h5>Manufacturing</h5>
<p>Currently all of our garments are manufactured in Northern California, USA.</p>

<h5>Packaging & Marketing</h5>
<p>We use only recycled materials for our business. All of our paper products are made from recycled paper, including marketing materials, product hang tags,  and internal office supplies. Our shipping materials are either made from recycled paper or 100% oxo-biodegradable plastic.</p>

<h5>Environmental Stewardship</h5>

<p>We are committed to supporting the efforts of other organizations that affect real change in environmental causes. Lazy Glamour is a member of 1% For The Planet, an alliance of businesses that understand the necessity of protecting the natural environment. Members understand that profit and loss are directly linked to the health of our environment, and are concerned with the social and environmental impacts of industry.</p>

<p>We contribute 1% of net annual sales to grassroots environmental groups with the sincere hope that our collective efforts are paving the way for more corporate responsibility in the business community and the recognition, support and patronage of conscientious consumers who value serious commitment to the environment.<p>
